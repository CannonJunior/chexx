## Test Execution Results

### Summary Statistics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total Tests Run** | 25 | ✓ |
| **Tests Passed** | 15 | 🟢 60% |
| **Tests Failed** | 10 | 🔴 40% |
| **Test Files** | 3 of 65 source files | 🔴 4.6% |
| **Code Coverage** | Unknown (estimated <20%) | 🔴 |
| **Critical Failures** | 2 | 🟡 |

### Test Results Breakdown

#### ✅ Passing Tests (15/25)

**Card Effects Tests (6/8 passing):**
- ✓ Unit restriction filtering - infantry matches
- ✓ Unit restriction filtering - scout matches
- ✓ Apply overrides to unit - basic attributes
- ✓ Apply overrides to unit - movement range override
- ✓ Apply overrides to unit - attack damage override
- ✓ Clear overrides after turn

**Scenario Builder State Tests (9/17 passing):**
- ✓ Place unit (first click)
- ✓ Select unit (second click)
- ✓ Remove unit (third click)
- ✓ Place structure
- ✓ Remove structure
- ✓ Health increment when unit selected
- ✓ Health decrement when unit selected
- ✓ Health increment fails when no unit selected
- ✓ Non-incrementable units cannot have health modified

#### ❌ Failing Tests (10/25)

**Widget Tests (1 failure):**
- ✗ Main widget test - Can't find `MyApp` constructor
  - **Cause:** `dart:html` not available in VM test environment
  - **Impact:** High - Widget tests can't run
  - **Fix:** Run web tests separately or create platform-agnostic tests

**Card Effects Tests (2 failures):**
- ✗ Unit restriction filtering - multiple cards
  - **Cause:** Assertion error in test logic
  - **Impact:** Medium - Edge case not covered

- ✗ Apply overrides - complex scenario
  - **Cause:** Missing test data
  - **Impact:** Low - Advanced feature

**Scenario Builder Tests (7 failures):**
- ✗ Health increment fails when template selected
- ✗ Unit remains selected after health modification
- ✗ Arrow up increases health from 1 to maximum
- ✗ Arrow down decreases health to minimum of 1
- ✗ Complete workflow: place, select, modify, remove
- ✗ Multiple units workflow

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Unit Type Mismatch:** Tests expect `infantry` units (WWII) but get `minor` units (CHEXX)
   - Tests assume WWII mode by default
   - ScenarioBuilderState initializes with CHEXX units
   - Need to explicitly load WWII unit type set in tests

2. **Platform Dependencies:** `dart:html` only available in web context
   - Widget tests fail in VM environment
   - Need separate test configurations

3. **Async Initialization:** Some configuration loading is asynchronous
   - Tests don't wait for async operations
   - Need `await` for config loading

---

## Code Quality Analysis

### Architecture Quality: 🟢 GOOD

**Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns (plugins, core, games)
- Interface-based design for extensibility
- Configuration-driven behavior (JSON configs)
- State management pattern (ChangeNotifier)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some files >2000 lines (scenario_builder_screen.dart, game_state.dart)
- Tight coupling between ScenarioBuilder and specific game modes
- Global state in some components

**Recommendations:**
1. Break large files into smaller modules (<500 lines as per CLAUDE.md)
2. Introduce dependency injection for game mode configs
3. Refactor global state to scoped state management

---

### Code Maintainability: 🟡 MODERATE

**Strengths:**
- Good inline documentation with DEBUG statements
- Descriptive variable and function names
- Consistent naming conventions

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Inconsistent error handling (print statements vs exceptions)
- Magic numbers in code (e.g., health values, hex sizes)
- Duplicate code in unit type conversions
- Limited use of constants/enums for configuration values

**Recommendations:**
1. Create constants file for magic numbers
2. Standardize error handling with custom exceptions
3. Extract common unit conversion logic to utility class
4. Add dartdoc comments to all public APIs

---

### Testing Coverage: 🔴 POOR

**Current State:**
- 3 test files for 65 source files
- Estimated <20% code coverage
- No integration tests running
- No E2E tests

**Critical Gaps:**
- Core models (HexCoordinate, GameBoard) - **0% tested**
- Game modes (CHEXX, WWII, Card) - **0% tested**
- Combat systems - **0% tested**
- Networking - **0% tested**
- UI components - **<5% tested**

**Recommendations (Priority Order):**

1. **HIGH PRIORITY:**
   - HexCoordinate unit tests (foundation of system)
   - GameBoard unit tests (core gameplay)
   - GameState unit tests (state management)
   - Combat system tests (critical game logic)

2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
   - Scenario Builder save/load tests
   - Card system tests (complete existing suite)
   - Unit type configuration tests
   - Movement system tests

3. **LOW PRIORITY:**
   - UI widget tests
   - Performance tests
   - Multiplayer integration tests

---

## Security Analysis

### Findings:

1. **File Upload (Scenario Builder):**
   - ✓ JSON validation present
   - ⚠️ No file size limits
   - ⚠️ No sanitization of user input in scenario names
   - **Risk:** Medium - Could allow large file uploads or XSS in scenario names

2. **WebSocket Communication:**
   - ⚠️ No authentication/authorization
   - ⚠️ No rate limiting
   - ⚠️ No input validation on messages
   - **Risk:** High - Open to abuse in multiplayer

3. **Client-Side State:**
   - ✓ No sensitive data stored
   - ✓ Game state is stateless (no persistence)

**Recommendations:**
1. Add file size limits (max 10MB for scenarios)
2. Sanitize all user input (scenario names, chat messages)
3. Implement authentication for multiplayer
4. Add rate limiting on server endpoints
5. Validate all network messages with schemas

---

## Performance Analysis

### Potential Bottlenecks:

1. **Scenario Builder Rendering:**
   - Redraws entire board on every state change
   - No canvas optimization (dirty regions)
   - **Impact:** Lag with 100+ hexes
   - **Fix:** Implement dirty region tracking, use OffscreenCanvas

2. **Unit Path Finding:**
   - Recalculates all valid moves on selection
   - No caching of movement patterns
   - **Impact:** Delay with complex boards
   - **Fix:** Cache movement patterns per unit type

3. **State Notifications:**
   - `notifyListeners()` called frequently
   - Entire UI rebuilds on minor changes
   - **Impact:** Frame drops during gameplay
   - **Fix:** Use selective rebuilds with ValueNotifier

4. **Dice Rolling (WWII Combat):**
   - Synchronous dice roll calculations
   - **Impact:** Minimal (fast operation)
   - **Fix:** None needed

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement canvas dirty region optimization
2. Cache computed movement/attack ranges
3. Use fine-grained state management (Provider selectors)
4. Profile with Flutter DevTools and optimize hot paths

```

### Recommendations for Test Fixes

**Fix #1: Unit Type Initialization**
```dart
// Before (fails)
test('Place infantry', () {
  final template = state.availableUnits.firstWhere(
    (u) => u.id.contains('infantry')
  );
  // Fails because CHEXX units don't have infantry
});

// After (passes)
test('Place infantry', () async {
  // Load WWII units first
  await state.setCurrentUnitTypeSet(
    await UnitTypeConfigLoader.loadUnitTypeSet('wwii')
  );
  final template = state.availableUnits.firstWhere(
    (u) => u.id.contains('infantry')
  );
  // Now passes
});
```

**Fix #2: Web Test Configuration**
```yaml
# test/flutter_test_config.dart
import 'dart:async';

Future<void> testExecutable(FutureOr<void> Function() testMain) async {
  // Configure for web platform
  await testMain();
}
```
