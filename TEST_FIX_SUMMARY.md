## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Removed Broken Widget Test
- **File:** `test/widget_test.dart`
- **Issue:** Placeholder Flutter template test incompatible with dart:html
- **Fix:** Removed file entirely
- **Impact:** Eliminated platform dependency issue

### 2. âœ… Added Async Unit Type Loading
- **Files:** All test groups in `test/scenario_builder_state_test.dart`
- **Issue:** Tests expected WWII units but got CHEXX units (default)
- **Fix:** Added async `setUp()` with `UnitTypeConfigLoader.loadUnitTypeSet('wwii')`
- **Impact:** 5 tests fixed

### 3. âœ… Fixed Click Cycle Logic
- **Files:** Click cycle tests in `test/scenario_builder_state_test.dart`
- **Issue:** Tests used `placeItem()` for 3-click cycle, but state layer doesn't implement cycles
- **Fix:** Changed to correct method sequence:
  - `placeItem()` â†’ place unit
  - `selectPlacedUnit()` â†’ select unit
  - `removeUnit()` / `removeStructure()` â†’ remove item
- **Impact:** 3 tests fixed

### 4. âœ… Added Template Selection Guard
- **Files:** `lib/src/models/scenario_builder_state.dart`
- **Issue:** Health modification allowed when template selected (placement mode)
- **Fix:** Added check in `incrementSelectedUnitHealth()` and `decrementSelectedUnitHealth()`:
  ```dart
  if (selectedUnitTemplate != null) {
    print('DEBUG STATE: FAILED - Template is selected (in placement mode)');
    return false;
  }
  ```
- **Impact:** Proper workflow enforcement

### 5. âœ… Fixed Health Starting Values
- **Files:** Health modification tests in `test/scenario_builder_state_test.dart`
- **Issue:** Tests expected health to start at 1, but WWII infantry starts at 4 (from config)
- **Fix:** Updated tests to:
  1. Use actual starting health from config (4 for infantry)
  2. Decrement first before testing increment (since starting at max)
  3. Handle case where units start at max health
- **Impact:** 2 tests fixed

### 6. âœ… Fixed Structure Removal
- **Files:** Structure click cycle test
- **Issue:** `placeItem()` replaces structures instead of removing them
- **Fix:** Changed to use `removeStructure()` method
- **Impact:** 1 test fixed

### 7. âœ… Fixed Template Deselection Workflow
- **Files:** Multiple health modification tests
- **Issue:** Template selection blocks health modification
- **Fix:** Added `state.selectUnitTemplate(null)` before health modification
- **Impact:** 2 tests fixed

## CI/CD Pipeline Setup

### GitHub Actions Workflows Created

#### 1. **test.yml** - Basic Test Workflow
- Runs on push to main/develop
- Runs on pull requests
- Steps:
  - Checkout code
  - Set up Flutter 3.24.3
  - Install dependencies
  - Run code analysis
  - Run tests with coverage
  - Upload coverage to Codecov

#### 2. **ci.yml** - Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline
- Multi-stage pipeline with job dependencies
- Jobs:
  - **analyze**: Code analysis + formatting check
  - **test**: Unit tests with coverage reporting + threshold check
  - **build-web**: Build web release
  - **build-linux**: Build Linux desktop release
  - **summary**: Overall pipeline status
- Coverage artifacts uploaded
- Build artifacts archived

#### 3. **pr-checks.yml** - Strict PR Validation
- Runs only on pull requests
- Strict analysis (fatal-infos, fatal-warnings)
- All tests must pass
- Checks for:
  - TODO comments (warns if >50)
  - Large files (warns if >500 lines)
- Provides PR summary in GitHub UI
