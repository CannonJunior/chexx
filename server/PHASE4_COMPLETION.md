# Phase 4 Completion: Lobby System

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## Summary

Phase 4 successfully implemented a complete lobby system for multiplayer games, including game room management, player ready states, and game start coordination. Both server and client sides are fully functional.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Server-Side Lobby System ✅

**Location:** `/server/game_server/lib/`

**Components Created:**
- `models/game_room.dart` - Game room model with player management
- `services/lobby_service.dart` - Lobby management service

**Game Room Model Features:**
- Room ID generation (6-character alphanumeric)
- Player management (2 players max)
- Player ready state tracking
- Game status lifecycle
- Host management
- Room info serialization

**Lobby Service Features:**
- Create game rooms
- Join existing rooms
- Leave rooms
- Set player ready state
- Start games (host only)
- List available rooms
- Handle player disconnections
- Auto-cleanup abandoned rooms

### 2. Server Message Handlers ✅

**Integrated into `bin/server.dart`:**

```dart
CREATE_GAME  → _handleCreateGame()
JOIN_GAME    → _handleJoinGame()
LEAVE_GAME   → _handleLeaveGame()
LIST_GAMES   → _handleListGames()
SET_READY    → _handleSetReady()
START_GAME   → _handleStartGame()
```

**Features:**
- Room creation with scenario selection
- Player join with validation (room full check)
- Ready state synchronization
- Host-only game start
- Room state broadcasting
- Disconnect handling with cleanup

### 3. Enhanced Test UI ✅

**Updated `lib/network/multiplayer_test_screen.dart`:**

**New Features:**
- Current room status display
- Player list with ready indicators
- Ready/Unready toggle button
- Start Game button (host only, when ready)
- Leave Game button
- Dynamic UI based on game state
- Real-time room updates

**UI Flow:**
1. **Disconnected** → Show connect button
2. **Connected** → Show create/join buttons
3. **In Room** → Show room status, ready button, start button
4. **Game Started** → Show game started message

### 4. Game Room Lifecycle ✅

**States:**
```
waiting     → Waiting for players to join
ready       → All players ready, can start
starting    → Game is starting
inProgress  → Game in progress
ended       → Game ended
abandoned   → All players left (auto-deleted)
```

**Transitions:**
- `waiting` → `ready` (when all players ready)
- `ready` → `starting` (host clicks start)
- `starting` → `inProgress` (game initialized)
- Any → `abandoned` (all players disconnect)

### 5. Player Ready System ✅

**Server Logic:**
- Track ready state per player
- Validate room can start (2 players + all ready)
- Broadcast room updates on ready state change
- Prevent start if not ready

**Client UI:**
- Toggle ready/unready button
- Visual indicator (green checkmark = ready)
- Disable start button until ready
- Show "Can Start" status

## Next Steps: Phase 5

Ready to proceed with **Phase 5: Game State Synchronization**:

1. **Implement Server-Side Game Logic**
   - Initialize game state from scenario
   - Process game actions
   - Validate moves
   - Update state

2. **State Synchronization**

   - Delta updates during game
   - Conflict resolution
   - Turn management

3. **Client Integration**
   - Receive and apply state updates
   - Send actions to server
   - Optimistic updates
   - Rollback on error

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours
