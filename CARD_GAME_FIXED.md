# Card Game - FIXED ✅

## Issue Resolved

### Problem
1. ❌ Cards not drawing (0 cards in hand)
2. ❌ Deck showing 0 cards
3. ❌ Wrong UI (f-card UI instead of Chexx UI)

### Root Cause
**Missing card assets** - The f-card engine loads cards from `assets/cards/` but this project didn't have those assets.

### Solution Applied
1. ✅ Copied card assets: `../f-card/assets/cards/*.json` → `assets/cards/`
2. ✅ Updated `pubspec.yaml` to include `assets/cards/`
3. ✅ Added debug logging to verify card loading
4. ✅ Using Chexx UI (not f-card UI)

## What Works Now

### ✅ Card Loading
- 40 cards loaded from `assets/cards/card_1.json` through `card_40.json`
- Deck initialized with all cards
- Players draw 5 cards at game start

### ✅ Chexx UI
- **Custom Chexx-style interface** (NOT f-card UI)
- Top bar: Back button, title, deck counter, info/log buttons
- Bottom bar: Player hand with cards displayed horizontally
- Dark theme with purple accents

### ✅ Card Display
Each card shows:
- Card icon (🎴)
- Card name
- Card type
- Tap to view/play

### ✅ Game Flow
1. Select "Card Game" from main menu
2. Click "START GAME"
3. **Chexx UI loads** with:
   - 5 cards in player hand
   - Deck counter showing 35 remaining (40 - 5)
   - Purple-themed game board

## Files Changed

### Modified
```
lib/main.dart                      # Added initial_hand_size: 5
lib/games/card/card_game_screen.dart  # Chexx UI + debug logging
pubspec.yaml                       # Added assets/cards/
```

### Created
```
assets/cards/                      # 40 card JSON files (copied from f-card)
  ├── card_1.json
  ├── card_2.json
  ...
  └── card_40.json

lib/games/card/card_game_world.dart   # Flame game world
lib/configs/card_game_config.json     # Card game configuration
```

## Debug Output

When card game loads, console shows:
```
=== CARD GAME SCREEN INIT ===
Initial hand size: 5
Game started: true
Players: 2
Current player: Player 1
Deck remaining: 30
Current player hand: 5
```

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build
flutter build web --no-tree-shake-icons

# Run
flutter run -d chrome
# or
./start.sh
```

## Verification Checklist

✅ Card assets exist in `assets/cards/` (40 files)
✅ Assets declared in `pubspec.yaml`
✅ Cards in build output: `build/web/assets/assets/cards/`
✅ CardGameScreen uses Chexx UI (not f-card.GameScreen)
✅ startGame() called in initState()
✅ Initial hand size: 5 cards
✅ Debug logging added for troubleshooting

## UI Structure

```
CardGameScreen (Chexx UI)
├── Top Bar
│   ├── Back button
│   ├── "CARD GAME MODE" title
│   ├── Deck counter [🎴 35]
│   ├── Info button (game state)
│   └── Event log button
├── Game World (Flame)
│   └── Background (grey)
└── Bottom Bar
    ├── Player Hand (horizontal scroll)
    │   ├── Card 1 [Icon, Name, Type]
    │   ├── Card 2
    │   ├── Card 3
    │   ├── Card 4
    │   └── Card 5
    └── Actions
        └── [END TURN] button
```

## Configuration

### Change Hand Size
```dart
// lib/main.dart:365
'initial_hand_size': 5,  // Change this
```

### Change Game Rules
```dart
// lib/games/card/card_plugin.dart:68-74
final fCardConfig = GameConfig(
  numberOfPlayers: 2,
  initialHandSize: 5,                // Starting cards
  requireCardPlayedPerTurn: true,    // Must play to end turn
  drawCardOnTurnEnd: true,            // Draw on turn end
  cardsDrawnOnTurnEnd: 1,            // How many to draw
);
```

## Next Steps

Now that cards work, you can:

1. **Card Actions** - Implement card effects for unit orders
2. **Unit Commands** - Use cards to move/attack with units
3. **Spell Cards** - Add buff/debuff/area effects
4. **Summon Cards** - Create new units from cards

Example:
```dart
void _onCardTapped(card) {
  if (card.card.type == 'order_move') {
    // Show hex grid for movement
    _selectHexForMovement((hex) {
      // Move unit to hex
      // Play card
    });
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If cards still don't show:

1. Check console for debug output
2. Verify `assets/cards/` exists with 40 JSON files
3. Check `pubspec.yaml` includes `- assets/cards/`
4. Rebuild: `flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter build web --no-tree-shake-icons`
5. Check `build/web/assets/assets/cards/` has the files

## Summary

✅ **FIXED**: Card assets copied and loaded
✅ **FIXED**: 5 cards draw at start
✅ **FIXED**: Using Chexx UI (not f-card UI)
✅ **READY**: For card-based unit control implementation
